# the same libraries as rocqchk -j 1, and reject a library as soon as one of
# its opaque proofs is ill-typed, whichever process checks it.
#
# The ill-typed proof is made by splicing: two compilations that differ only
# in one lemma have opaque tables with the same layout, so the library segment
# of the first one (where the lemma has type U) together with the opaques
# segment of the second one (where its proof has type U -> U) makes a well
# formed .vo whose proof of that lemma does not have the type it claims.
