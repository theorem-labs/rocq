# binary-equivalence-taiga#841 Review841 round 3, test "l1_locality_change_refused"
# (new). A's `f` goes from default locality to `Local` (cst_locl changes;
# B still resolves `f` unqualified). A fresh compile of B against the
# `Local` A fails ("reference not found" / "unbound"). Reusing B.vo must
# now refuse too (round 3's fix: CONSTANT's cst_locl/cst_warn are KEYED
# subset-checked, not wholesale excluded).
