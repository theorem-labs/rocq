# binary-equivalence-taiga#841 Review841 round 10 (Lean round 10 review,
# issuecomment-6198625773, fixture "lc2", P3). Symmetric counterpart to
# lc1: X declares `Definition foo := 1.`. B uses the TERM `foo` directly
# (no Import at all). W is then rebuilt to add an UNRELATED top-level
# `Module foo. ... End foo.` -- a MODULE, not a constant, reachable only
# transitively through A's `Require Export`. B's own reference to the term
# `foo` resolves through the term Nametab, entirely unaffected by any
# module sharing the same name: a fresh compile of B still succeeds.
# Before round 11's fix, W's module label for foo wrongly collided with
# X's constant foo in the shared bare-basename shadow space; round 11
# separates them.
